***Card Generator :***

The code contains a few conditions (if) and a loop (while).

The starting condition checks that there is no error when choosing the cards, the second selects the type of card and adds a first number according to it (visa or mastercard).

The while loop adds 15 random numbers to make the complete map.

And I post it last.
