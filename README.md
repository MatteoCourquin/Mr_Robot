***Card Generator :***

The code contains a few conditions (if) and a loop (while).

The starting condition checks that there is no error when choosing the cards, the second selects the type of card and adds a first number according to it (visa or mastercard).

The while loop adds 15 random numbers to make the complete map.

And I post it last.

***Password Generator :***

First, I check (with an if) if the user entered a number. If it is not the case I return an error to him.

Then (in a while loop) I generate random numbers and letters.

Then I mix it all up and display my password proposal
